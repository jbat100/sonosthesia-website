//p.text-center.vertical-space-sm The Sonosthesia project aims to offer new ways for artists to create interactive audio/visual digital art. It lives at the intersection of audio, music, graphics, CGI, visualisation, physics simulations, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, virtual and augmented reality and live artistic performance. It hosts tools and software extensions to create bridges between these domains, implementing current and new ideas emerging from research institutions. It's time for a new age of digital art to hit the mainstream.

// p.text-center.vertical-space-sm The Sonosthesia project offers new ways to create interactive digital art by allowing artists to create virtual three-dimensional environments which can both control and react to sound. It aims to provide new possibilities for artists in the music, games and CGI industries by extending virtual reality engines and digital audio workstations, taking inspiration from current audio visual arts research. It's time for a new age of digital art to hit the mainstream.

        h1.title Connect Software and Build Bridges


        p.subtitle.lead Sonosthesia uses a powerful language to create intuitive cross-domain control flows between virtual reality engines, visual programming environments, digital audio workstations and creative deep neural networks. Through this a symbiosis of living sound, visuals, physics and haptics emerges, resulting in truly immersive performance environments.

        // super cool diagram goes here

        p.subtitle.lead We allow diverse tech-artists to join a collaborative, interactive software eco-system by augmenting their existing work environment through a set of extensions. Breath new life into your art with endless combinations. Together we are stronger. Come join the fun.

        h1.title Perform in Virtual Reality

        p.subtitle.lead In the real world we can generate sounds by tapping, thumping, scraping, scratching, pinching, plucking, strumming and so much more. We aim to reproduce these interactions in VR, taking advantage of new input devices and powerful physics engines.

        // super cool diagram goes here

        p.subtitle.lead You can control anything by using the software bridges provided by Sonosthesia. Use colors, textures or shapes to describe the way objects behave when manipulated, the possibilities are endless.

        // super cool diagram goes here

        p.subtitle.lead Bring the audience into the virtual performance environment so that they can experience it first hand. They can even interact with the environment themselves. Your audience will no longer be passive observers but participants who can breath life into your artistic content.
