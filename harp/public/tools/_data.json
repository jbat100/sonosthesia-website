This project is derived from Adam Stark's Sound Analyser. Sound analysis can be performed using a variety of algorithms from the Gist library and others, additional analysis options are planned. You can use the sound going through any channel or bus in your DAW as a controller for anything that understands sonosthesia control protocols, anywhere on your local network.",
