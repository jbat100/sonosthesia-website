h2 Sonosthesia-Analyser

h3 Origins and Motivations

p This project is derived from Adam Stark's #[a(href="http://www.adamstark.co.uk/sound-analyser") Sound Analyser] project, the source code for which can be found #[a(href="https://github.com/adamstark/Sound-Analyser") here]. In an #[a(href="http://adamstark.co.uk/pdf/papers/nime-2014-sound-analyser.pdf") accompanying academic paper] Adam Stark describes his vision in more detail, a vision which is closely related to that of Sonosthesia.

    p.quotation Real-time audio analysis has great potential for being used to create musically responsive applications in live performances. There have been many examples of such use, including sound-responsive visualisations, adaptive audio effects and machine musicianship. However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms themselves, or programming – or both. [...] In response, this paper introduces the Sound Analyser – an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications for live performances and installations.

p Sound analysis can be performed using a variety of algorithms from the #[a(href="https://github.com/adamstark/Gist") Gist Library] and others.

h3 Project Overview

p The Sonosthesia-Analyser project aims to expand on the original Sound-Analyser in a number of ways. First by expanding the number of available analyses by incorporating the work of a number of other open source projects. Secondly, by allowing the result of audio analyses to be assigned to different control groups and control descriptors as defined in the #[a(href="../concepts") concepts] section. It also allows multiple OSC targets (host/port combinations) to be selected simultaneously for additional flexibility. A number of other additional features are planned such as operators (offsets, multipliers, non-linear mappings etc...).

h3 Source and Downloads


p The source for the project is #[a(href="https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-analyser") available on Github]. It is an audio plugin based on the #[a(href="https://www.juce.com/features") JUCE toolkit] which allows the product to be compatible with a number of standards, most significantly VST and AU. Here are some pre-compiled binaries but you can tweak the JUCE project to your needs if they are not sufficient (and feel free to contribute...).
