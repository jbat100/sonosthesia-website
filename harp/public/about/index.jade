            h1.title New Opportunities for Digital Arts

            p.subtitle Sonosthesia aims to promote the development of interactive digital art forms. It offers a set of #[a(href="../tools") tools] for digital artists to extend their existing work environments and hosts #[a(href="../projects") artistic projects] which demonstrate the use of these tools. It is generally meant as a platform for exchange and collaboration around digital arts, in particular focusing around the emerging field of virtual reality.

            h1.title Virtual Reality as a Performance Environment

            p.subtitle The idea of virtual sound worlds which can both react to and control sound in real-time is a central driving force behind Sonosthesia. A number of key concepts make virtual reality as a performance environment a truly inspiring goal, and the current VR revolution driven by Occulus, HTC, Sony, Unity and other key players is finally edging this goal to within reach.

                h3 Inbuilt Physics

                p Our real-life experience of sound control is impossible to dissociate from physics. We generate sounds by tapping, thumping, scraping, scratching, pinching, plucking, strumming... The physics behind all these actions are intuitive to us, we do not need to understand them mathematically in order for them to make sense. They can however be described in terms of collisions, contacts or friction by the physics engines which are central to any virtual reality platform. VR has the potential to emulate and augment real-world object manipulation using these intuitive concepts, generating a stream of physics related data which can be used to provide organic, lifelike experiences of sound and graphics.

                h3 Gestures in Context

                p Virtual reality gives context to gestures, something which has been missing from a previous gestural interfaces. We intuitively expect the result of our gestures to be dependent on their effect on the local environment. A drummer can use the same stick motions to create a great number of different sounds by varying impact points. In the same way, the context brought by a virtual world allows performers to create endless control variations from a limited gestural vocabulary by giving virtual objects different control characteristics which can be encoded in their color, texture, size, shape or any other attribute.

                h3 Spectator Immersion

                p Virtual reality is that it is simultaneously an interaction context and a rendering context, which can greatly enhance the feeling of presence. It allows the audience to be immersed in the performance environment, experiencing, understanding and connecting with the performer's interactions at a deeper level, and possibly also affecting the content themselves. In a sense this blurs the distinction between performers and audience, and turns passive observers into participants who can breath endless life into artistic content.

        h1.title Building Bridges

        p.subtitle Sonosthesia does not aim to provide full blown software solutions attempting to solve the technical challenges of interactive digital arts. Instead it aims to create bridges between existing software in order to allow them to communicate, control and stimulate each other. This is done through the use of scripts, plugins, libraries or whatever other means of extensions the software packages allow. The main challenge for Sonosthesia is providing a powerful common language for these interactions. Of particular interest are virtual reality game engines, visual programming environments, and digital audio workstations. These different tools do very different things, and guide artistic creation in different ways. In the end, building these bridges will bring a wealth of current artists closer to the project, with all their expertise and audiences. Audio-visual art can be mainstream, it just needs to reach out.

            h3 Virtual Reality Game Engines

            p VR game engines such as Unity and Unreal offer game developers and artists functionality which is of obvious interest for Sonosthesia, such as advanced scene editing, guizmos, particle systems, unified shader languages, powerful profiling tools and hugely abundant and versatile online asset stores. They also produce extremely portable and adaptable software, which will work with a wide array of input devices, exploit the latest in hardware and run on a wide variety of platforms including desktop, mobile, web and most importantly emerging head mounted displays aiming to democratise virtual reality.

            h3 Visual Programming Environments

            p Visual (or patcher) programming languages such as #[a(href="https://cycling74.com/products/max") Max] and #[a(href="https://puredata.info/") PureData] have been at the forefront of interactive digital arts research for a while, and for good reason. Their data and control representation is naturally suited to real-time reactive systems and the integration of both sonic (MSP) and graphical (Jitter) tools is a great asset for the creation of multi-modal content. The recent addition of high-level content generation and processing tools such as #[a(href="https://cycling74.com/2015/09/15/a-few-minutes-with-beap-tutorial-series") BEAP] and #[a(href="https://cycling74.com/2010/11/19/introducing-vizzie") Vizzie] make Max all the more appealing.

            h3 Digital Audio Workstations

            p Digital audio workstation (DAWs) are a primary tool for music composition and production, sound design, and most importantly live musical performances. They have extensive and intuitive tools for sequencing, mixing, orchestrating, processing, routing, loops, scores, automation, metadata and much more. This allows artists to easily create clear timbral, harmonic and temporal structure which is often missing in current audio-visual art. Although it could be argued that an environment like visual programming lamguages like Max could replicate this structuring functionality, it would be difficult make it as usable and cohesive as packages like Logic Pro, Ableton Live or Pro Tools.
